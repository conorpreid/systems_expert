# Proxies

### Terms before beginning
- Forward Proxy
  - a server that sits between a client and server
  - acts on behalf of the client, often to mask identity
  - often referred to as just proxies
- Reverse Proxy
  - still a server that sits between a client and server
  - but instead acts on behalf of the server
  - typically for logging, load balancing, caching
  - helps reduce load on the server itself
  - load balancing is the best application of proxies
- Nginx
  - "engine x"
  - webserver that often used as a reverse proxy and load balancer

### Getting into it
pretty simple to understand \
forward proxy == proxy \
a proxy is a server that sits inbetween a client (ro set of clients) and a server (or set of servers)
