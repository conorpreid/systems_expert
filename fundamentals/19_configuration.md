# Configuration

### Terms before beginning
- Configuration
	- a set of parameters or constants that are critical to a system
	- tyically written in JSON or YAML
	- can be static (hard coded in and shipped with the systems application code)
	- or dynamic, meaning it lives outside the system application code

### Getting into it
Its the converse of integrating variables / params into the code itself \
No *better* format \
With static - when you make a change, you have to completely redeply to see the change \
With dynamic, this isn't the case \
Dynamic is backed by some DB that the system queries \
Remember you can also deploy the change to X% of users too
