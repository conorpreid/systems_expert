# What are Design Fundamentals

### Ambiguity
Questions in interviews are often very ambiguous and high level \
They will ask "how would you design YouTube" / "Airbnb" \
You have to turn that into a 30/40/60 minute discussion, so ask lots of questions \
You need a lot of fundamentals as building blocks to do this \
Its not possible to just reason about this stuff using existing (non dedicated) knowledge like you might with an algorithms question \
You need to actually know the fundamentals

### Coding interviews != Design interviews
Former is more objective, later is less so \
No single correct answer, but rather a suggested solution that is good at some things (the *some things* comes from the questions you ask the interviewer) and not so good at others \
Suggested solution needs to be justified, thats the job of the interviewee \
Discuss what the solution is good for, not good for, defend/adapt your position under questions from interviewer \
In order to do that, you need the fundamentals

### Fundamentals come in four buckets
1. Foundational systems design knowledge
   - If you don't understand these, you have massive gaps in knowledge
   - At worst, you are incapable of beginning to tackle problems
   - eg client server model, network protocols
2. Key characteristics of systems
   - Things you want the system to have, often involving trade offs
   - Things like availabilily, consistency, redundancy, latency, throughput
   - Have to know about this stuff
3. Components of a system
   - More tangible
   - Load balancers, proxies, caches, rate limiting, leader election
   - Facilitates the key characteristics you are shooting for
4. Actual tech
   - Existing products or services, off the shelf solutions
   - Real tools you can plug in to build up the system

Theres a lot to know here, its non-trivial stuff \
This course has condensed the material into the most useable and actionable info
