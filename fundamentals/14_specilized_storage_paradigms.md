# Specialized Storage Paradigms

### Terms before beginning
- Blob storage
  - not really db's
  - only allow the storage and retreival of data based on the name of that blob (so like key value store?)
  - like key value store, but diff guarantees. might be slower, but values can be megabytes large (or GB)
  - usually used to store things like binarues, database snapshots, images and other static content
  - tools like GCS or S3
- Time Series db's
  - TSDB optimized for storing and analyzing time indexed data
  - that is, data points that specifically occur at a given moment in time
- Graph db
  - stores data following the graph data model
  - data entries have explicitly defined relationships, like nodes in a graph can have edges
  - complex queries that rely in such relationships are thus quicker
  - used for social networks for example
- Cypher
  - this is a graph query language
  - originally developed for Neo4j, but now can be used for others
  - much simplier than their SQL counterparts
- Spatial db
  - optimized for storing and querying spatial data like locations on a map
  - rely in spatial indexes like quadtrees (explained below)
  - used to find (eg) all locations in the vicinity of a region
- Quadtree
  - used to index twoD spatial data
  - each node either has zero children (its a leaf) or 4
  - typically, quadtree node contain some form of spatial data (locations on a map) with a max capacity *n*.
  - so long as nodes aren't at capacity, they remain leafs. once they reach capacity, they're given four children nodes and their data entries are split across the four
  - ideal for stroing spatial data because it can be represented as a grid filled with rectangles that are recursively subdivided into four sub-rectangles, where each quadtree node is represented by a rectangle and each rectangle represents a spatial region
  - assuming we're storing locations in the world, a quadtree with max *n* would look like
    - the root node is the entire world (outter most triangle )
    - if the world has more than *n* locations, the outermost rectangle is divided into four quadrants (regions)
    - so long as a region has more than *n* locations, that rectangle is subdivided into four
    - regions that have fewer than *n* locations are undivided rectangles (leaf nodes)
    - the parts of the grid that have many subdivided rectangles are densely populated, whereas the parts that have few subdivided rectangles represetn sparsely populated areas
  - finding a iven location in a perfect quadtree is super quick, O(log_4(x)) where x is the total num of locations
- Google Cloud Storage
  - GCS is a blob store service provided by Google
- S3
  - blob store service provided by Amazon through AWS
- InfuxDB
  - open source time series db
- Prometheus
  - open source time series database, typically used for monitoring
- Noe4j
  - graoh db that consists of nodes, relationships, properties, labels

### Getting into it
- Blob store
  - stands for binary large object
  - arbitary piece of unstructured data
  - doesnt fit into a SQL db / tabular
  - kind of like key value store
    - blob's are massive amounts of data
    - key value stores solve for latency
    - blobs for data volumes
    - so don't confuse the two
- Time Series
  - often used for monitoring purposes
  - data relative to time
  - time series like computations
    - aggregate between time
    - max / min
  - used for IOT too / stocks etc
- Graph
  - graph data structure
  - used when there are a lot of relationships between enties
  - SQL not optimised for this (you get loads of joins etc)
  - build on top of a graph data model
  - relationships are primary (SQL it's implied)
  - social networks
  - most popular is Neo4j
- Spatial
  - locations on a map
  - SQL database indexs are good for singel column, to make queries pretty quick
  - but not when you want to do queries on things like latitude and longitude, thats where spatial comes in
  - you have spatial index
